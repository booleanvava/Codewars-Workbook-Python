# Codewars-Python-Katas

This is a repository with my solutions from Codewars. I plan to do one every day. It will also cotain solutions to a book called "The Python Workbook" by Ben Stephenson.

My target is to finish all 177 exercises from the book, and to reach Kyu 1 in Codewars.

Starting date is 01 Feb 2021, and the target date is 01 Feb 2022.
